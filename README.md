Model: RANDOM FOREST  is a tree-based machine learning algorithm that leverages the power of multiple decision trees for making decisions. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our modelâ€™s prediction. A large number of relatively uncorrelated models (trees) operating as a committee will outperform any of the individual constituent models.
